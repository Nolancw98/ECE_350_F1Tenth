# F1Tenth
This is a backup of files that were submitted for my Intro to Robotics Class in Spring 2021. Significant versions of each algorithm are stored in the root folder.  However, rrt and rrt_star were not finished by the end of the class.  

Final lab reports and supporting documents are stored in the respective lab folders.  Additionally, it is worth mentioning that my partner and I won all three races hosted during the semester.  The Race 2 is the most interesting because it was the only race where the physcial F1TENTH cars were used in the race, the report is stored in the race2 folder.
